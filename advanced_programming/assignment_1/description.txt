 Design a Python program to help a teacher randomly divide a class into teams for a number of assignments.

The teacher has information about all of the students in the class in students.csv, which is a file in csv format and would like the output to be also written to a csv file, something like assignment-teams.csv.

The teacher would also like, in so far as is possible,

    for each student to be in a team with different students for each assignment;
    that the teams are all of the same size (plus or minus one);

The Python program should take four arguments

    the number of assignments
    the number of students per team
    the name of the input csv file
    the name of the output csv file
